1. Were you surprised by your pre-test score? What category(s) do you plan to focus on?
Honestly, yes—I was a bit surprised. I thought I had decent control over my emotions, but the score showed I still have work to do, especially in Self-Management. It made me reflect on how I react under pressure or when things don’t go as planned. I’ve realized that staying calm isn’t just about being silent—it’s about managing what's going on inside. So that’s an area I’m going to work on intentionally. Also, I plan to focus on Relationship Management, because at the end of the day, success is very much tied to how well we work with people.

 2. Which of the four categories would you rate as the most important for anyone to learn first? (Self-Awareness, Self-Management, Social Awareness, Relationship Management) Why?
I believe Self-Awareness is the foundation. If you don’t know what you’re feeling or why you’re reacting a certain way, how can you possibly manage it? Or connect well with others? The book made it clear that our emotions are triggered before we even realize it—because the signals go through the emotional (limbic) part of our brain first. So unless we take time to slow down and understand ourselves, everything else gets harder. Once we build that internal awareness, managing ourselves and relating to others becomes much more authentic and effective.

3. Have you ever been in a situation like Butch in the first chapter of the book? Professionally or personally. How did you handle it? What did you do to remain calm or were you not able to remain calm at all?
Yes, actually—I had a moment during a big project presentation when something went wrong with the demo. I froze for a few seconds, just like Butch did in the water. I could feel that internal panic rising, and I had to consciously remind myself to breathe and ground myself. I couldn’t just react emotionally in front of clients. I tried to stay calm, acknowledged the issue with honesty, and moved to Plan B. Looking back, I’m proud of how I handled it, but in that moment, it took a lot of mental effort to shift from fear to problem-solving.

4. What did you learn new in the first chapter? For example, the EQ journey of Sensory vs Limbic vs Cerebral? Or does someone with High IQ automatically have a high EQ? Or someone with a lower IQ have low EQ?
I found it fascinating that our emotional responses are triggered before logical thinking even kicks in. That whole idea of signals passing through the limbic system before reaching the rational part of the brain really hit me. It made me realize why it’s so easy to overreact in the moment. Also, I had assumed that people with high IQs naturally had high EQ too—but this chapter totally debunked that. It was eye-opening to see that EQ can be developed over time, no matter where you start. That’s actually really encouraging.

5. Is there any feedback you would like to share with the larger group based on your Chapter 1 discussions?
Yes, I’d suggest that we encourage each other to reflect more on our emotional triggers—those moments that catch us off guard. Everyone has them, and sharing real stories (like Butch’s or even small daily experiences) makes the learning more relatable. Also, I think it would be great if we could try short mindfulness or self-awareness exercises as a team—even just once a week. These small habits could help us grow our EQ together, rather than just reading about it in isolation.



1. Were you surprised by your pre-test score? What category(s) do you plan to focus on?
Yes, a little. I realized I need to improve Self-Management, especially under pressure, and focus more on Relationship Management.

 2. Which of the four categories would you rate as the most important to learn first? Why?
Self-Awareness is key. Without understanding your own emotions, it’s hard to manage them or build strong relationships with others.

 3. Have you ever been in a situation like Butch’s? How did you handle it?
Yes, during a tough client meeting, I felt frozen. I paused, took a deep breath, and focused on staying calm and responsive rather than reactive.

 4. What did you learn new in the first chapter?
Emotions are felt before logic kicks in due to the brain’s wiring. Also, IQ doesn’t determine EQ—EQ can be developed over time.

 5. Any feedback to share with the larger group?
Sharing real examples of emotional triggers can help us all grow. Regular team reflections or exercises could make EQ learning more practical.
